private let hotKeyLogger = HexLog.hotKey

/// A state machine that processes keyboard events to detect hotkey activations.
///
/// Implements two complementary recording modes:
/// 1. **Press-and-Hold**: Start recording when hotkey is pressed, stop when released
/// 2. **Double-Tap Lock**: Quick double-tap locks recording until hotkey is pressed again
///
/// # Architecture
///
/// The processor maintains three possible states:
/// - `.idle`: Waiting for hotkey activation
/// - `.pressAndHold(startTime)`: Recording active, will stop when hotkey released
/// - `.doubleTapLock`: Recording locked, requires explicit hotkey press to stop
///
/// # Double-Tap Detection
///
/// A "tap" is a quick press-and-release sequence. The processor tracks release times:
/// - First tap: Press hotkey → release → record release time
/// - Second tap: If pressed within `doubleTapThreshold` (0.3s), enters `.doubleTapLock`
/// - The lock persists until the user presses the hotkey again or presses ESC
///
/// # Press-and-Hold Behavior
///
/// Standard recording mode:
/// - Hotkey pressed → `.startRecording` output, enter `.pressAndHold` state
/// - Hotkey released → `.stopRecording` output, return to `.idle`
/// - Different key pressed within threshold → cancel (accidental activation prevention)
/// - Different key pressed after threshold → ignored (intentional simultaneous input)
///
/// # Modifier-Only Hotkey Specifics
///
/// For hotkeys with no key component (e.g., Option-only):
/// - "Press" = all required modifiers held, no key pressed
/// - "Release" = any required modifier released
/// - Uses higher minimum duration (0.3s) to prevent conflicts with OS shortcuts
/// - Mouse clicks within threshold → silent discard (prevents Option+click conflicts)
/// - After threshold, only ESC cancels (mouse clicks ignored)
///
/// # Dirty State & Backsliding Prevention
///
/// After cancellation or with extra modifiers, processor enters "dirty" state:
/// - All input ignored until full release (key:nil, modifiers:[])
/// - Prevents accidental re-triggering during complex key combinations
/// - User cannot "backslide" into hotkey by releasing extra modifiers
///
/// # ESC Key Handling
///
/// Pressing ESC always cancels active recordings:
/// - Returns `.cancel` output (plays cancel sound)
/// - Enters dirty state to prevent immediate re-triggering
/// - Works in both `.pressAndHold` and `.doubleTapLock` states
///
/// # Example Interaction Flow
///
/// ```
/// // Simple press-and-hold (Cmd+A hotkey)
/// Event: Cmd+A pressed   → Output: .startRecording, State: .pressAndHold
/// Event: Cmd released    → Output: .stopRecording, State: .idle
///
/// // Double-tap lock (Option hotkey)
/// Event: Option pressed  → Output: .startRecording, State: .pressAndHold
/// Event: Option released → Output: .stopRecording, State: .idle
/// Event: Option pressed  → Output: .startRecording, State: .pressAndHold
/// Event: Option released → Output: nil, State: .doubleTapLock (locked!)
/// Event: Option pressed  → Output: .stopRecording, State: .idle
///
/// // Accidental trigger prevention
/// Event: Cmd+A pressed         → Output: .startRecording, State: .pressAndHold
/// Event: Cmd+B pressed (0.1s)  → Output: .stopRecording, State: .idle (different key)
/// ```
///
/// # Related Components
///
/// - `RecordingDecisionEngine`: Determines if recording duration meets minimum thresholds
/// - `KeyEvent`: Input events from keyboard monitoring
/// - `HotKey`: Configuration of which key/modifiers to detect
